# An_Intelligent_Connect-6_Player
 An Intelligent Connect-6 Player using the Minimax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning,  and Heuristic Functions. 


Project Context: 

The project addresses the development of an intelligent player for the Connect-6 game, an extended version of Connect Four. This game is known for its heightened complexity, presenting a challenging problem for AI systems due to the larger 19x19 grid. 
 

Implementation Focus: 

Our implementation focuses on integrating the Minimax algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and heuristic functions. These components collectively form the backbone of an AI player capable of making strategic decisions in a highly intricate gaming environment.
